# Angular NgRx NX Realworld Example App

<img src="logo.png" alt="RealWorld Example App" width="200"/>

### Modern Angular features:

- New Control Flow
- Deferred Loading
- Zoneless
- Signal inputs and outputs
- State management using NgRx Signals Store
- DI using the inject function
- Functional resolvers and guards

A simple, scalable, and powerful architecture for building production ready React applications.

## Introduction

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with [Angular](https://angular.dev/), [ngrx/signals](https://ngrx.io/guide/signals), [nrwl/nx](https://nx.dev/) including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more. It is an implementation of the [RealWorld apps](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) project. The purpose of the `RealWorld apps` project is to demonostrate how you can build the same "realworld" app using different technologies in the front-end and on the back-end.

This specific implementation was created in 2017 and it is constantly migrated to the latest versions of Angular and it utilizes most of the features of the Modern Angular era. You can help us to maintain this project in various ways. You can find some of them in the [how to contribute]() guide.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.

Feel free to explore the sample app codebase to get the most value out of the repo.

## What makes a React application "bulletproof"?

This repo doesn't aim to be a silver bullet for all React applications as there are many different use cases, but it tries to provide a solid foundation for building applications based on the following principles:

- Easy to get started with
- Simple to understand and maintain
- Uses the right tools for the job
- Clean boundaries between different parts of the application
- Everyone on the team is on the same page when it comes to how things are done
- Secure
- Performant
- Scalable in terms of codebase and team size
- Issues detectable as early as possible

#### Disclaimer:

This is not supposed to be a template, boilerplate or a framework. It is an opinionated guide that shows how to do some things in a certain way. You are not forced to do everything exactly as it is shown here, decide what works best for you and your team and stay consistent with your style.

To get most out of it, do not get limited by the technologies used in this sample app, but rather focus on the principles and the concepts that are being presented here. The tools and libraries used here are just a suggestion, you can always replace them with something that fits your needs better. Sometimes, your project might require a slightly different approach, and that's totally fine.
